  - **Issues**: None identified.
- **gameLogic.js**: 
  - **Logic Check**: Contains core logic for build actions. The validation logic is implemented correctly.
  - **Issues**: None identified.

## services
- **ActionHandler.ts**: 
  - **Logic Check**: Manages game actions. The validation logic using `BuildValidator` is correct.
  - **Issues**: None identified.
- **ActionManager.ts**: 
  - **Logic Check**: Manages game actions and highlights. The integration with `ActionStrategyContext` is correct.
  - **Issues**: None identified.
- **GameBoardManager.ts**: 
  - **Logic Check**: Manages the game board state. The logic for calculating valid moves is correct.
  - **Issues**: None identified.
- **gameLogic.ts**: 
  - **Logic Check**: Acts as the central logic layer. The state transition logic is correct.
  - **Issues**: 
    1. **Void Type Issue**: The expression `if (result && this.stateMachine && this.stateMachine.updateStateData)` tests for truthiness on a `void` type, which is invalid.
    2. **Return Type Mismatch**: The `return result;` statement attempts to return a `void` type where a `boolean` is expected.
    3. **Undefined Variable**: The variable `state` is used multiple times but is not defined.
  - **Suggestions**:
    - Ensure `result` is of a valid type (e.g., `boolean`) before testing for truthiness.
    - Define the `state` variable or import it if it is external.
    - Adjust the return type of the `result` variable to match the expected `boolean` type.
- **GameManager.ts**: 
  - **Logic Check**: Coordinates game state and actions. The turn management logic is correct.
  - **Issues**: None identified.

## Duplicated Logic

### Move Validation Logic
- **Files Involved**:
  - `GameBoardManager.ts`
  - `ActionHandler.ts`
  - `MoveStrategy.ts`
- **Details**: The logic for validating moves (e.g., checking height differences, occupied positions, and valid directions) is repeated across these files.
- **Suggestions**: Extract the common move validation logic into a shared utility or service to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

### Build Validation Logic
- **Files Involved**:
  - `BuildValidator.ts`
  - `ActionHandler.ts`
  - `BuildStrategy.ts`
- **Details**: The logic for validating build positions (e.g., checking adjacency, height constraints, and occupied positions) is duplicated across these files.
- **Suggestions**: Consolidate the build validation logic into a single module or service to avoid redundancy and potential inconsistencies.

### State Synchronization
- **Files Involved**:
  - `GameContext.jsx`
  - `GameLogic.ts`
  - `GameStateMachine.ts`
- **Details**: The logic for synchronizing game state between Redux, the state machine, and the UI is implemented in multiple places.
- **Suggestions**: Centralize the state synchronization logic in a dedicated service or middleware to streamline updates and reduce complexity.

### Logging
- **Files Involved**:
  - `UniversalLogger.ts`
  - `GameLogger.ts`
- **Details**: Both files implement logging functionality, leading to potential overlap in their usage.
- **Suggestions**: Evaluate the need for both logging utilities and consider merging them into a single, unified logger.

### Cube and Player Position Management
- **Files Involved**:
  - `Cube.jsx`
  - `Player.jsx`
  - `GameBoardManager.ts`
- **Details**: The logic for managing cube and player positions (e.g., updating positions, checking adjacency) is repeated across these files.
- **Suggestions**: Create a shared utility or service for position management to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.
